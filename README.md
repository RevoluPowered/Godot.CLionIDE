# Godot.ClionIDE
A simple repo which contains a configuration for clion - with compilation db support :)

# How to use
1. Make a folder in your godot root
2. call the folder .idea
3. clone this repository into there
4. install BEAR compilation db tool from https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear
5. Make sure you have used clang! you cannot do this with gcc.

This should let you use 'find by definition' etc and use the built in refactoring tools without cmake.

Enjoy!
